Questions
Is linear ~ uncorrelated?
Uncorrelated actually means perfectly ferromagnetic for m=0?



Before draft
Clarify: Gates act between sites.
         Entropy *values* are defined between sites (at cuts)
         Up or down steps are defined on sites (between cuts)

After draft
S[i] is a cut BETWEEN site i and site i+1!!! If there are N sites there N cuts, but offset?
For entropy functions, when we specify N=100, there should actually be 100 sites, meaning the array should be 101 long
