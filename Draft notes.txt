Try to count zero energy states
Also try to break this symmetry
  Maybe longitudinal field?


Need sources for 
  Time Indep OTOC
  Unitarity and information loss


How much should I describe the Keyserlingk paper?
  How often should I cite it?
Should I call the entanglement entropy the entanglement? bitartite entanglement? EE? $S$?
Quote from Jonay before 2.2
Is there an easy way to recover the von Neuman entropy?
