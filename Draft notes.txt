Second half of introduction
2.1: Thermalization
2.4: Information velocities
  Lieb Robinson
  Butterfly
Real evolution
\sigma vs S
Multiple of 8
Hamiltonian figures
  Fix titles
  Label axes
4.3.1: Surface growth
Fix OTOC discussion
Combine left and right stairs to get large v_B/v_E
Large stairs have no correlation effects 
Check stair/gate normalization
  All fucked up around v_E, v_B
Correlations
