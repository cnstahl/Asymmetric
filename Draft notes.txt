Try to count zero energy states
Also try to break this symmetry
  Maybe longitudinal field?





Are two site Hamiltonians always symmetric?
  Operator spreading
  Preservation of information
Notation for three site swap
  Try \ket{\alpha\beta\gamma}
Formatting
Entanglement velocity graphs
  Convexity
Include calculation of the triple product?
  Yes
  But not the 4-site transition matrix
