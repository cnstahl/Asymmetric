	Thermalization is an important aspect in quantum physics from condensed matter to black holes. It allows initially local information to be spread and hidden throughout a system. This spreading happens at a finite speed, and can be quantified using the butterfly velocity $v_B$ or the entanglement velocity $v_E$. Although many sources have explored these sources, fewer explore the ratio $v_E/v_B$, and little work has been in describing asymmetric butterfly velocities. In this thesis we find both a time-independent system and a quantum circuit with different butterfly velocities in either direction, which we call $v_{B\pm}$. Although in the Hamiltonian system the two velocities are still close in magnitude, the ratio $v_{B+}/v_{B-}$ can be made arbitrarily large in the circuit model.
