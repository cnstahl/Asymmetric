\begin{abstract}
	Quantum circuits provide simple toy systems to analyze entanglement growth and operator spreading in many-body systems. We study the behavior of these systems under various architectures. When the dimensionality of each site is large, deterministic behavior emerges. This behavior can be used to calculate entanglement entropy growth rates and correlation in steady states, which are tested using numerical simulations.
