\section{Operator Spreading in Time-Independent Hamiltonian Systems} \label{sec:opsp}

Just do all intro here, and then decide later what to put into the circuit section

Thermalization 
  vs localization 
  happens by spreading information
  mention that this is how information loss happens

Discuss information movement in Time-Independent Hamiltonian systems
  Find a source for this
  Ideally introduce OTOC and Pauli end weight here
  Also entanglement possibly
  What is the relationship between entropy and OTOC?
  Argument about extremal slope
    From Nahum: stairs to separate $v_B$ and $v_E$
    

For now use Jonay paper, but hopefully find another. Could use Keyserlingk but it would be nice to save that for the discussion of random unitary dynamics.

Although most sources consider symmetric dynamics [CITE] this is not a requirement. Find the Nahum paper that discusses asymmetric systems.
