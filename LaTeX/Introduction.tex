Motivate information speeds.

Scrambling, unitarity and information loss?

Why do we care about asymmetry?

Entropy can be used to study topological properties in systems with mass gaps~\cite{Kitaev2006}. In conformal field theories entropy informs the scale of the renormalization group flow~\cite{Casini2011, Myers2011}.
