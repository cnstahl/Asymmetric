@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="We note that the usual definition of the classical Lyapunov exponent involves averaging the logarithm of the factor by which perturbations grow over initial states and perturbations. This is subtly different from the classical analog of the quantum OTOC where the commutator/Poisson bracket is averaged before taking the logarithm. It is worth exploring in future studies whether or not this difference in definitions has any qualitative consequences\cite {Galitski_lyapunov}."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="Here $\protect \mathaccentV {tilde}07E{v}_B({\protect \bf  \protect \mathaccentV {hat}05En})$, with a tilde, denotes the normal propagation speed of a straight front whose normal is parallel to ${\protect \bf  \protect \mathaccentV {hat}05En}$. In Ref.~\cite {opspreadAdam} this was denoted $v_B({\protect \bf  \protect \mathaccentV {hat}05En})$, but here we use $v_B({\protect \bf  \protect \mathaccentV {hat}05En})$ to denote the speed at which an initially local operator spreads away from the origin in the direction ${\protect \bf  \protect \mathaccentV {hat}05En}$. These differ because in the absence of rotational symmetry the operator's front is not in general perpendicular to the radial vector, but they are related by a geometrical construction known from classical droplet growth \cite {WolfWulff, krug1991solids,opspreadAdam}."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="The expression on the left-hand side of (\ref {eq:classicalquantity}) becomes a ``partition function'' for two paths. The local weights $\partial u({\protect \bf  y}_{i+1}, i+1) / \partial u({\protect \bf  y}_{i}, i)$ depend not only on ${\protect \bf  y}_{i+1}$ and ${\protect \bf  y}_{i}$ but also on the configuration $u({\protect \bf  y_i},i)$. The chaotic time-dependence of $u({\protect \bf  y}_i,i)$ means that the configurational average has a similar effect to averaging over weakly correlated randomness in the weights. Since we are averaging the ``partition function'', rather than its logarithm, this is an annealed average, and $-\lambda ({\protect \bf  v})t$ is an annealed ``free energy'' for the pair of paths. The quenched free energy, in which we take the logarithm before averaging, would give the more conventional definition of the Lyapunov exponent \cite {livi1992scaling,kaneko1992propagation,pikovsky1994roughening}."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="{Inside the light cone there is a large deviation form governing convergence to the saturation value: ${C_{1d}^{\protect \rm  rc}(x,t) \sim 1- \protect \qopname  \relax o{exp}{\setbox \z@ \hbox {\frozen@everymath \@emptytoks \mathsurround \z@ $\nulldelimiterspace \z@ \left (\vcenter to\@ne \big@size {}\right .$}\box \z@ }{-\protect \frac  {(v-v_B)^2}{2D} t}{\setbox \z@ \hbox {\frozen@everymath \@emptytoks \mathsurround \z@ $\nulldelimiterspace \z@ \left )\vcenter to\@ne \big@size {}\right .$}\box \z@ }}$. The exponent here is the continuation of $\lambda (v)$ outside the front. However, in the higher dimensional examples, the large deviation form inside the front scales with a distinct power of $t$, $t^d$ in $d$ spatial dimensions \cite {MajumdarKPZTail}. In the presence of additional conserved densities (like energy or charge), the late time saturation of the OTOC is a power-law in time instead of exponential~\cite {KhemaniCons, TiborCons}.}"}
@FOOTNOTE{Note5,key="Note5",note="{ In random circuits related random walk pictures underlie the calculation of both the OTOC and the second Renyi entropy \cite {opspreadAdam, opspreadCurt}. In these random systems this yields a relation between $\lambda (v)$ and the ``entanglement line tension'' defined in \cite {jonay}, specifically the line tension $\protect \mathcal  {E}_2(v)$ for the second Renyi entropy. This motivates the conjecture, for non-random systems, that $\lambda (v)|_\protect \text  {cont} = - s_\protect \text  {eq} ( \protect \mathcal  {E}_2(v) - v)$, where $s_\protect \text  {eq}$ is the thermal entropy density. The left hand side denotes the analytic continuation of $\lambda (v)$ from ${v>v_B}$ to values $v<v_B$. In random circuits we must distinguish different kinds of averages. The line tension extracted from a calculation of $\protect \overline  {e^{-S_2}}$ determines $\lambda (v)$ for the average OTOC $\protect \overline  {C(x,t)}$ by the above formula. It is natural to expect that the line tension determined by the more natural direct average $\protect \overline  {S_2}$ determines $\lambda (v)$ for the typical value of the OTOC, $\protect \qopname  \relax o{exp}\protect \overline  {\protect \qopname  \relax o{ln}C(x,t)}$. The average and typical values of the OTOC are parametrically close in the region close to the front, but they may differ significantly in the far-front regime where both are exponentially small.}"}
@FOOTNOTE{Note6,key="Note6",note="{In some circuit models in $d>1$ (which do not have continuous spatial rotation symmetry) some sections of the operator's front can be ``glued'' to the strict lightcone defined by the discrete time circuit \cite {opspreadAdam}. This is a peculiar case where ${v_B( {\protect \bf  \protect \mathaccentV {hat}05En} ) = v_\protect \text  {LC}( {\protect \bf  \protect \mathaccentV {hat}05En})}$ for some directions ${\protect \bf  \protect \mathaccentV {hat}05En}$ in space, so that no nontrivial $\lambda ({\protect \mathbf  v})$ can be defined for these directions of ${\protect \bf  v}$.}"}
@FOOTNOTE{Note7,key="Note7",note="Let the probability distribution for weak-link ``waiting times'' be ${P(\tau )\sim \tau ^{-a-2}}$. At weak disorder $(1<a)$ the broadening of the operator's front \cite {NahumRuhmanHuse} is diffusive, as in the clean system. At intermediate disorder (${0<a<1}$) the front broadens more strongly, giving ${\lambda (v)\sim -(v-v_B)^{(a+1)/a}}$. For strong disorder ($-1<a<0$) the butterfly speed vanishes: in this regime ${\lambda (v)\sim - |v|^{1-|a|}}$. In the disordered system the definition of $\lambda (v)$ depends on whether we consider e.g. the mean or the typical value of the OTOC, but this should not change these exponents."}
